      <description><![CDATA[This Implementation Guide is part of the <strong>interopEHRate</strong> project. Details on the project background are available at interopEHRate.eu he goal of this Implementation Guide (IG) is to specify the HL7 FHIR profiles to represent the content that is exchanged via the research protocol defined in the project interopEHRate and evaluated in project pilot. This IG includes new types of profiles, as no working group deals with the topic of research data sharing in a similar way and based on H17 FHIR R4. Appropriate basic resources such as research studies are used as a basis.]]></description>
